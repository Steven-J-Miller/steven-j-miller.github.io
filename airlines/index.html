        <h1>Airline Safety</h1>
        <p class="lead">In recent years, a lot of media attention and scrutiny has been focused on the safety of
        airline travel. Is the hype to be believed? Is airline travel unsafe?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <h4>Number of Crashes</h4>
        <p>While the number of plane crashes did see an uptick in 2008, the overall trend of plane crashes has been on the
            decline since 1999. Note that this graph includes all non-military flight incidents worldwide, including small
        aircraft. </p>
        <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
                src="graphs/plane_crashes_by_year.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>

        <p>When we adjust our data to account for only crashes involving planes with at least ten passengers aboard, we
        see an even better decrease in crashes and an increase in safety. Commercial air travel is safer than ever and
        only improving.</p>
        <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
                src="graphs/plane_crashes_by_year_at_least_10.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>

        <h4>Fatalities</h4>
        <p>When we look at the annual number of fatalities, we can see that this has decreased to nearly one quarter of
            the 1985 number, from 2,406 down to 583. Considering 2.208 <strong>Billion</strong> passengers flew in 2008,
        this is an impressively low number.</p>
        <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
                src="graphs/fatalities.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>

        <h4>Comparison to Automobiles</h4>
        <p>To put the improvement in airline safety in perspective, let's take a look at automobile safety in the same
        time period.</p>

        <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
                src="graphs/auto_fatalities.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
        <p>Automobile fatalities had been on a decrease until recently, but the decline had not been anywhere near as drastic
        as the decrease seen in airline fatalities. Automotive fatalities peaked in 2005 at approximately 43,500 before declining
        to 32,479 in 2011. Even at this lowest point, 30 times as many people died due to an automobile crash than a commercial
            plane crash.</p>

        <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
                src="graphs/pedestrian_fatalities.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
        <p>Even walking down the street is more dangerous than flying in a commercial plane. In 2008, 583 people died in commercial
        plane crashes. That same year, 4,414 pedestrians died in automotive crashes. They weren't even choosing to drive. They
            just happened to be nearby during a crash and were unfortunately involved.</p>

        <p>The reality is quite simple. Airline travel is safer than ever. Fatal commercial airline crashes are continuously
        decreasing and are at all-time lows. Other forms of transportation, even walking down the street, cannot say the same.
        Concerns about airline safety are disproportionately stoked by the fact that commercial plane crashes have become so rare,
        when they do occur, it is major news. This leads to headlines and concerns about the safety of airlines despite data showing
        that they're safer than ever before. Meanwhile, over a hundred people die every die in car crashes and it has become so common
        that it is just accepted as part of life. It may get mentioned on the local news for a couple minutes, particularly if
        it happens to inconvenience the morning commute of others, but everyone moves on. Commercial plane crashes, on the other hand,
        happen so rarely that when one takes place anywhere in the world it becomes covered on every TV station, website and
        social media network nonstop for days.</p>
